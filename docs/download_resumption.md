# Download Resumption Implementation

This document describes the implementation of download resumption capability for the Gemma model files in StudyBuddy.

## Problem Statement

The Gemma model consists of multiple large files (parameter shards up to 250MB each), which can be problematic to download in poor network conditions. Network interruptions previously required restarting downloads from the beginning, wasting bandwidth and time.

## Implementation

We added download resumption functionality to `GemmaModelDownloader`:

1. **Partial File Detection**:
   - Checks for existing `.tmp` files that indicate partial downloads
   - Determines the number of bytes already downloaded

2. **HTTP Range Requests**:
   - Uses the HTTP `Range` header to request only remaining bytes
   - Detects if the server supports partial content (HTTP 206 response)
   - Handles range not satisfiable errors (HTTP 416)

3. **Append Mode**:
   - Opens output streams in append mode for resumption
   - Preserves partial downloads during network errors

4. **Progress Tracking**:
   - Adjusts progress calculation for resumed downloads
   - Shows accurate progress including previously downloaded portions

## Testing

We implemented a test method `testDownloadResumption()` in `GemmaModelDownloaderTest` that:

1. Starts downloading a parameter shard
2. Simulates a network interruption at ~15% progress
3. Verifies the partial file is retained
4. Attempts to resume the download
5. Confirms successful completion with proper byte range requests

## Benefits

- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: Only downloads the missing portions of files
- **Improved User Experience**: Less frustration from failed downloads
- **Reliability**: Higher likelihood of successful downloads on spotty connections
- **Speed**: Faster overall downloads when resuming

## Limitations

- Requires servers that support HTTP range requests (Hugging Face does support this)
- Will restart downloads if the server version of the file changes
- Some edge cases (like server not supporting partial content) require fallback to full downloads

## Future Improvements

- Add system to verify partial downloads with checksums before resuming
- Implement exponential backoff for retry attempts
- Add UI indicators to show when a download is being resumed vs. started fresh
