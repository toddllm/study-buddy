# StudyBuddy Project Status

This document provides the current status of the StudyBuddy app development.

## Current Implementation Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| JNI Bridge Implementation | ‚úÖ Complete | Basic implementation with simulated responses |
| Native Library Integration | ‚úÖ Complete | All required shared libraries included |
| Model Assets | ‚úÖ Placeholder | Model directory structure in place with sample files |
| UI Implementation | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Basic chat UI implemented, needs refinement |
| OCR Integration | ‚ö†Ô∏è Planned | Not yet implemented |
| Image Classification | ‚ö†Ô∏è Partial | Basic implementation in place |

## Next Steps

1. **Complete Model Integration**
   - Test MLC-LLM initialization with real model files
   - Measure performance on target devices
   - Optimize quantization parameters

2. **Polish UI**
   - Implement loading indicators
   - Add model selection UI
   - Improve chat experience

3. **Add OCR Features**
   - Integrate MLKit for text recognition
   - Add document scanning UI
   - Implement text extraction from images

4. **Performance Optimization**
   - Optimize memory usage
   - Improve startup time
   - Reduce battery consumption

## Known Issues

1. **Model Size**
   - The Gemma 2B-IT model is large (1.1GB) and may cause storage issues on some devices
   - Solution: Implement model download on first run with user consent

2. **Memory Usage**
   - Current implementation may use excessive memory during inference
   - Solution: Optimize quantization and implement memory-efficient inference

3. **Library Compatibility**
   - Some Android devices may have issues with the native libraries
   - Solution: Test on a wider range of devices and create device-specific builds if needed

## Build Verification

The current build has been tested on:

- Pixel 7 Pro (Android 14)
- Samsung Galaxy S23 (Android 13)
- Emulator with Pixel 6 configuration (Android 13)
