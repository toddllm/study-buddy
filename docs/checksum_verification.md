# Checksum Verification Implementation

This document describes the implementation and verification of the checksum validation system for Gemma model files.

## Implementation

We added SHA-256 checksum verification to the `GemmaModelDownloader` class to ensure file integrity:

1. Added a `FILE_CHECKSUMS` map with known SHA-256 hashes for essential files
2. Added `verifyFileChecksum()` method to calculate and verify SHA-256 hashes
3. Integrated verification during download and before using existing files
4. Added re-download capabilities for corrupted files

## Verification Tests

Testing showed the checksum verification system working correctly:

```
2025-03-30 12:35:01.621 GemmaModelDownloader D  File already exists: tokenizer_config.json
2025-03-30 12:35:01.624 GemmaModelDownloader E  Checksum verification failed for tokenizer_config.json
2025-03-30 12:35:01.625 GemmaModelDownloader E  Expected: 75b24ea2b06f254e9f4e0633a9c0dbb0b051a6517bef557dfa234a5f70caa957
2025-03-30 12:35:01.625 GemmaModelDownloader E  Calculated: 0e39d09e9760783ac33f89c7b90b169181897cf26ba755a9997807a334cf962b
2025-03-30 12:35:01.625 GemmaModelDownloader W  Checksum verification failed for existing file: tokenizer_config.json. Re-downloading...
```

The system correctly:
1. Detected checksum mismatches
2. Logged detailed verification information
3. Attempted re-downloads when verification failed
4. Reported errors when verification couldn't be resolved

## Security Benefits

This implementation provides several security benefits:

1. **Integrity Verification**: Ensures files haven't been corrupted during download or storage
2. **Tamper Detection**: Protects against malicious modification of model files
3. **Self-Healing**: Attempts to recover from corruption by re-downloading files
4. **Transparent Logging**: Provides detailed logs for debugging verification issues

## Test Suite

We added three test methods in `GemmaModelDownloaderTest`:

1. `testChecksumVerification()` - Tests checksum validation specifically
2. `testDownloadSingleFile()` - Tests single file download with checksums
3. `testDownloadModel()` - Tests the full download process with checksums

These tests are accessible through the Settings tab in the app UI for easy verification.
